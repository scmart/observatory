What is it?
-------------
This package was forked from the original observatory to support the Meteor blaze rendering engine. (https://github.com/jhoxray/observatory)


This is Observatory-blaze v0.4.0 - a [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) package that provides powerful, efficient
and pretty logging, monitoring and application management for [Meteor framework](http://meteor.com) application development and 
deployment.
[See it in action and read full usage docs!](http://observatoryjs.com/).


What does it do?
------------------
* Easy logging with different log levels with corresponding methods for message output, optional 
logging to console, pretty output of both Client and Server logs right in the browser, optional logging of
the currently logged-in user for additional control.

* Augomagical logging, profiling and error handling for DDP, http, Collections, Subscriptions, Template lifecycle methods and any custom code

* Monitoring of your application internals: currently, Templates with all events and a Session object; much more to come.

* Coming up soon! Full-featured cloud-based monitoring and management of your Meteor applications.

Installation
-----------------
#### With meteorite:

	mrt add observatory-blaze

Usage
---------
